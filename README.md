# Colorado-Housing-Project-R-Studio

# In this project using linear analysis with both the Gamma and Box-plot regressions, such things as the prices, square footage, and number of bedrooms or bathrooms can be predicted using the code. I did a powerpoint describing my tasks and what I found along with a report.
